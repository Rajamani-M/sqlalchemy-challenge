# Climate Analysis and Exploration

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing climate data for Honolulu, Hawaii, using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Flask. It is divided into two main parts:

1. **Climate Data Analysis**: Perform basic analysis and exploration of climate data using SQLAlchemy and Pandas.
2. **Climate API Design**: Design a Flask API to provide endpoints for retrieving climate data.

## Repository Structure

- `SurfsUp/`
  - `app.py` - Flask application containing routes for the API.
  - `climate_starter.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with climate data analysis.
  - `Resources/` - Folder containing data files.
- `README.md` - This file.

## Part 1: Climate Data Analysis

### Precipitation Analysis
1. Find the most recent date in the dataset.
2. Query the previous 12 months of precipitation data.
3. Load the results into a Pandas DataFrame and sort by date.
4. Plot the results and print summary statistics.

### Station Analysis
1. Calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.
2. Find the most-active station and the number of observations.
3. Query the temperature statistics (min, max, avg) for the most-active station.
4. Plot a histogram of temperature observations for the last 12 months.

## Part 2: Climate API Design

### Flask Routes
- `/` - Home page listing all available routes.
- `/api/v1.0/precipitation` - JSON representation of precipitation data for the last 12 months.
- `/api/v1.0/stations` - JSON list of all stations in the dataset.
- `/api/v1.0/tobs` - JSON list of temperature observations for the most-active station over the last year.
- `/api/v1.0/<start>` - JSON list of min, avg, and max temperatures from the start date to the end of the dataset.
- `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>` - JSON list of min, avg, and max temperatures between the start and end dates.

# Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis and exploration of climate data for Honolulu, Hawaii. The data analysis component offers insights into precipitation patterns and station activity, while the Flask API provides easy access to climate data through various endpoints. By leveraging SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Flask, this project demonstrates the power of combining data science with web development to create informative and accessible climate data tools. Future enhancements could include adding more data sources, expanding the API functionality, and deploying the Flask application to a cloud service for wider accessibility.
